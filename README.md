### *Executive Summary/Abstract*
Nowadays, children spend a lot of time with gadgets. This has raised concerns about its potential impact on their cognitive development and creativity. Therefore, it is necessary to develop attractive and interactive educational media for children. One solution is to develop an interactive story game application. So, how can an interactive story game application help improve children's intelligence and creativity? FasimagiLand is the solution. This application is an educational game for 4-7 years old children that is designed to combine storytelling and drawing activities. Children will be invited to read stories interactively, where each sentence must be illustrated with a sketch before moving on to the next sentence. The development of this interactive story game application is an effort to answer the problem of the lack of attractive and interactive educational media for children in the digital age. This application is expected to provide benefits for children in improving their intelligence and creativity.
